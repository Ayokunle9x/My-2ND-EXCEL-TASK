## My-2ND-EXCEL-TASK
## USING PIVOT TABLES AND CHART TO VISUALIZE DATA


After another week of learn how to manipulate data on excel, i moved on to learning how to visualize data with pivot tables, in my learning i discovered that using pivot table is an easy way to get quick insight to data and know more about the fact and figures.In order to use pivot tables one has to navigate to "insert" on the excel dashboard so as to be able to use and manipulate data with pivot table.
I was given a task which requires me to make use of pivot table(the data set was provided by my instructor), the questions are as follows,
Using the Medical Students Data, create Pivot Tables displaying the following:
<li>Average values for the following for Male and Females (Age, BMI, Temperature, Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, and Cholesterol)
<li>Average Height and Weight for both Genders (in 2 decimal places)
<li>Number of students across the different Blood Groups
<li>Number of Students who smoke and those who don’t
<li>Number of Students who have diabetes and those who don’t.<LI></LI>
 A picture of the data set.

## The pivot chart of the data visualized
Pivot chart is another way of visualizing data apart from using tables. to use pivot chart one has to create pivot tables.

Visualizing the insights gotten from the Pivot Tables created in the previous TASK using the ‘Medical Students’ Data
